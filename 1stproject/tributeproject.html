        In a quaint town nestled between rolling hills and a shimmering lake, Adaeze Uzo-Nwosu was born in the early hours of the morning. From a young age, her stubborn nature and unyielding spirit were evident to all who knew her. Growing up, she roamed her childhood home, always seeking new discoveries and embracing the wonders of the natural world. <br>
        As Adaeze entered her teenage years, she became observant, resourceful, and callous. Her curiosity and passion for knowledge led her to explore the never ending world of science and technology. During an excursion, she had a life-changing experience when she encountered a real life demonstration of all she have seen in the movies. This ordeal taught her essential survival skills and deepened her connection with science.<br>
        After completing her formal education, Adaeze yearned to explore beyond her hometown. Armed with a knowledge and boundless determination, she embarked on a solo journey into the tech space. From the dense jungles of the niegrian companies that love cheap labor to the struggles of being up to date with the current technology, she immersed herself in the diversity of technology and ecosystems, gaining wisdom from each encounter.<br>
